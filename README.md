# US Accidents Data Analysis Project

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the US Accidents dataset using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**. The goal is to uncover insights about traffic accidents in the United States by performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and data visualization.

## Introduction

Traffic accidents pose significant challenges to public safety and urban planning. By analyzing accident data, we can identify patterns, risk factors, and potential areas for improvement in traffic management and road safety measures.

This project analyzes the US Accidents dataset to uncover insights into factors contributing to accidents, such as weather conditions, road features, temporal patterns, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents), which contains information about traffic accidents that occurred in the United States from February 2016 to June 2021.

**Dataset Features:**

- Over 2.8 million accident records.
- 49 states covered.
- Features include time, location, weather conditions, and various road attributes.

**Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size. You can download it from the link above.
